## Abstract

The project introduces FoodSAM, an advanced model that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for improved accuracy in food ingredients segmentation. It utilizes datasets like UECFoodPixComplete, SA-1B, FoodSeg103, and Objects365 to demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying detailed food items. The results show significant potential for FoodSAM in health and dietary management applications.
